# 🚀 DSA Practice Repository

This repository is designed for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  This is a comprehensive learning endeavor focused on understanding and implementing core DSA fundamentals through hands-on coding practice.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a structured learning platform for mastering fundamental data structures and algorithms. Rather than focusing on competitive programming, the goal is to build a solid foundation through practical implementation and understanding of core concepts, progressing from basic to medium complexity algorithms.

## 📚 Learning Focus Areas

The repository covers essential DSA topics including:

- **Arrays & Searching/Sorting Algorithms** - Including external sorting techniques
- **Linear Data Structures** - Linked lists, stacks, and queues
- **Tree Structures** - Binary trees, BSTs, balanced trees (AVL, B-trees)
- **Graph Theory & Algorithms** - Topological sorting, Dijkstra's shortest path, Prim's MST
- **Memory Management** - First-fit allocation, garbage collection, buddy system
- **File Structures** - Organization and management techniques

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into a clear, topic-based structure:

```
📦 dsa-practice/
├── 📂 C++/
│   ├── 📂 questions/          # Topic-based question collections
│   │   ├── array_questions.cpp
│   │   ├── linked_list_questions.md  
│   │   ├── stacks&queue.md
│   │   └── ... (other topic files)
│   ├── 📂 src/                # Individual solution implementations
│   │   ├── 📁 arrays/         # Solutions for array questions
│   │   │   ├── (question1.cpp)
│   │   │   ├── (question2.cpp)
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── 📁 linked_lists/   # Solutions for linked list questions
│   │   │   ├── (question1.cpp)
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── ... (other topic folders)
│   └── 📂 tests/              # Test files and examples
```

## 🔗 How Questions and Solutions Connect

Each file in the `questions/` folder contains **multiple questions** related to a specific topic:
- `array_questions.cpp` - Contains various array-related problems
- `linked_list_questions.md` - Contains linked list implementation challenges
- `stacks&queue.md` - Contains stack and queue problems

For every topic in the questions folder, there's a **corresponding folder** in the `src/` directory:
- Each question from the topic file gets its **own solution file** in the respective src folder
- This allows for clean organization and easy navigation between problems and their implementations

## 🎓 Learning Approach

This repository emphasizes:
- **Practical Implementation** over theoretical study
- **Progressive Difficulty** building from fundamentals to intermediate concepts
- **Clear Code Structure** with well-commented implementations
- **Multiple Approaches** where applicable for the same problem

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. Browse the `questions/` folder to find topics of interest
2. Read through the problem statements in the topic files
3. Navigate to the corresponding folder in `src/` to see implementations
4. Run and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding

Happy coding and learning! 🎉
