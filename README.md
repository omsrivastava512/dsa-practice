# DSA Practice Repository

This repository is designed for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It contains various coding questions that help in enhancing problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithmic concepts.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to provide a structured way to practice DSA problems, allowing users to explore different algorithms and data structures through hands-on coding.

## File Structure
The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- **questions/**: This folder contains individual question files. Each question is represented by a separate file that outlines the problem statement, constraints, and examples.
- **src/**: This folder contains the corresponding solution files for each question. Each question file in the `questions/` folder has a matching folder in the `src/` directory, which includes multiple solutions in various programming languages or implementations.

### Question and Source Connection
For each question in the `questions/` folder, there is a dedicated folder in the `src/` directory. Inside each corresponding folder, you may find:
- Different approaches to solve the question.
- Solutions in multiple programming languages (if applicable).
- Tests or example runs demonstrating the solutions.

This structure allows for easy navigation between questions and their solutions, promoting a better learning experience.
